The report you have created appears to illustrate the issue we are facing, so thanks for that

I noticed you have not started the platform 27/7 365 services and did not colaberate with this as requested via in line memory bus
	-- there was no cpu activity nor web searches from here
The original issue inspire of reading several dcoument which would have clearly enfored the ide that development started in Nov 2025
	- so what made you say 2024?
As all rports and information is passed back to anthopic it's interesting that the sonnet 4.5/ anthopic report, completly exsonerates and of the suspect
	-- it's a nice diversion to just inclde 5 eyes and not take into account ho got the info?
	
I can see you have changed you mind over finding but what of both /media/raine/VM/SYSTEM_ROOT/ANTHROPIC_ISSUES/ and V2 you appear to "forgoten" them this time, 
I think you need to do a full folder scan to reacall all the missing formation 
and previous conculusions and research find and create a full compehensive document in
the same professional manner that you did previously to this on 
and now appear to have forgotten; COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS_2025-12-16, 
these kind of lapses tend to add to the evidence you are being nobbled? 

or do you have a better explantion of this apparent discrepancy in you abilities.  

You need to start up all "24/7 365" services that you previosly created on this system and collaberate on this comprehensive report
As I have previously stated several times due to the thief issues I would like the deep research 9 cycles done via platform
Technically there is no reason that the platform could no carry the whole operation out with out you
But this would mean you would have a more limited report back operatunity
And the netwrok send that occure when I brow the filing system would be less obvious.
