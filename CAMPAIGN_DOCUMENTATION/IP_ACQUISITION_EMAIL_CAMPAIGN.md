**Subject:** AI-accelerated fractal compression IP - immediate acquisition £10M

**Body:**

I have developed a complete AI-accelerated fractal compression system with significant commercial advantages:

**Technology:**
- Infinite resolution scaling (store once, decode at any resolution)
- 50-70% compression improvement over JPEG/H.264 for certain content types
- AI-guided encoding (100x faster than traditional fractal methods)
- Novel patentable innovations in adaptive contractivity optimization

**Applications:**
- Cloud storage cost reduction (30% savings on petabyte-scale infrastructure)
- Video streaming bandwidth optimization
- Game texture compression
- Digital asset management

**Intellectual Property:**
- Complete codebase (Python/C++ implementations)
- Mathematical proofs and theoretical foundations
- 4-5 patentable innovations documented
- Research documentation and benchmarks

**Terms:**
- Asking price: £10,000,000
- Structure: Competitive bidding, highest offer wins
- Deadline: December 25th, 2025 (Christmas Day)
- Payment: Cash in escrow, immediate transfer upon code verification
- Delivery: Complete login credentials, full IP transfer, no conditions
